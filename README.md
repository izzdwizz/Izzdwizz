  <summary><h3>üéûÔ∏èThe Journey so far</h3></summary>
My journey began in 2017 when I worked with Munarealestate, a real estate company focused on providing affordable housing to citizens in Nigeria. I was responsible for updating content on their WordPress website, ensuring a seamless user experience and smooth navigation.
In 2019, I transitioned to working with HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and CSS when I had the opportunity to build Elielsngs‚Äô ecommerce website. Collaborating with a team, I created interactive user interfaces for viewing various store items and implemented a functional shopping cart system. This project allowed me to showcase my skills in frontend development and contributed to an enhanced user experience.
During my internship at Bluetag Technologies in 2021, I explored backend development while primarily working with C# and other dotnet packages. I built console applications, simulated systems, and utilized entity framework for efficient database management. However, my passion for frontend development drove me to specialize in this field. Immediately after my internship, I delved into React to build compelling component-based user interfaces. I gained proficiency in state management and mastered leveraging React hooks to interact with RESTful APIs, as well as mastering other styling libraries such as SCSS, Tailwind and AntDesgin.
In one of my personal projects, Ordinatrum, I developed a functional cryptocurrency application using React and Redux Toolkit. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of working with RESTful APIs and demonstrated my ability to create dynamic and responsive frontend applications. Moreover, my most recent project, Intelligentia, provided me with a sound knowledge of utilizing Next.js to build full-stack applications. Whilst working on this, I gained knowledge on how to implement some basic backend functionalities such as CRUD operations.
The journey is still progressing and I realize there's so much more to learn and grasp in this ever growing world of technology, I'll be sure to take you along.
